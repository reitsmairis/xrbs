## Project Structure 
1) [`FSRED_post_processing`](./FSRED_post_processing.ipynb): This notebook is used to preview, calibrate, and extract photometric FourStar image data of possible X-ray binary (XRB) counterparts within a presumed error circle indicating the XRB position.
2) [`open_files`](./open_files.ipynb): This notebook is used for opening the fits and cat files resulting from FSRED.
3) [`psf`](./psf.ipynb): This notebook is used for doing psf on blended or undetected sources.
